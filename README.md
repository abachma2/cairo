# CAIRO
CAIRO : Computerized Artificially Intelligent Reactor Operator.  

## Currently in development:
- A robust simulator of a nuclear power plant
- Simulated control room controls
- An artificial neural network that can operate these simulated controls. 

### Dependencies

1. `moose` available [here](https://github.com/idaholab/moose), installation instructions for `moose` are available [here](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/getting_started/installation/ubuntu.html)
2. `moltres`, a reactor simulator based on the `moose` framework. Available [here](https://github.com/arfc/moltres). 
3. `pyrk`, a nuclear reactor point kinetics package. Available [here](https://github.com/pyrk/pyrk)
4. `pygame`, enables game scripting with python. To install run in bash: `pip install pygame`.
